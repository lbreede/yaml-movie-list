overview: Winter 1968 and showbiz legend Judy Garland arrives in Swinging London to
  perform a five-week sold-out run at The Talk of the Town. It is 30 years since she
  shot to global stardom in The Wizard of Oz, but if her voice has weakened, its dramatic
  intensity has only grown. As she prepares for the show, battles with management,
  charms musicians and reminisces with friends and adoring fans, her wit and warmth
  shine through. Even her dreams of love seem undimmed as she embarks on a whirlwind
  romance with Mickey Deans, her soon-to-be fifth husband.
