overview: The fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of bitter rivals. One, James Kirk,
  is a delinquent, thrill-seeking Iowa farm boy. The other, Spock, a Vulcan, was raised
  in a logic-based society that rejects all emotion. As fiery instinct clashes with
  calm reason, their unlikely but powerful partnership is the only thing capable of
  leading their crew through unimaginable danger, boldly going where no one has gone
  before. The human adventure has begun again.
