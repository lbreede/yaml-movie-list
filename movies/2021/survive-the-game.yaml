overview: When cop David is injured in a drug bust gone wrong, his partner Cal chases
  the two criminals who shot him. They all land at a remote farm owned by troubled
  vet Eric, and as Cal and Eric plot their defense, more of the gang arrives - along
  with a wounded David. Outnumbered, the three heroes must use stealth, smarts, and
  good shooting to take down the drug-dealing mob.
