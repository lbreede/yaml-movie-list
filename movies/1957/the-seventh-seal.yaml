overview: When disillusioned Swedish knight Antonius Block returns home from the Crusades
  to find his country in the grips of the Black Death, he challenges Death to a chess
  match for his life. Tormented by the belief that God does not exist, Block sets
  off on a journey, meeting up with traveling players Jof and his wife, Mia, and becoming
  determined to evade Death long enough to commit one redemptive act while he still
  lives.
